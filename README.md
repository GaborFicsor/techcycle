## Deployment

>**IMPORTANT**
>
>***This section is not ready yet, some changes might needed to make to reflect the process of the development***
>
>***Things to consider:***
> * Initial steps of repository creating
> * Initial steps of django project setup
> * Check heroku deployment section for correctness
> * Check Hosting service section for the database
> * Section of storing static files with cloudinary or aws is completely missing
> * Check env.py file creating section
> * Check heroku deployment steps section
> * Additional steps might need to be included during development, such as
>   * stripe section
>   * other

1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in the browser
2. Open the [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)
3. Click **'Use this Template'** button and select **'Create a new repository'**
4. Enter a name for the project and an optional description
5. Click the **'Create Repository from Template'** button
6. Once the repository is created we can open a new workspace with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in 2 ways:
    1. Install [Gitpod - Always ready to code](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) Google Chrome extension
        * If we added this extension to our Google Chrome browser, a green 'Gitpod' button will show up in our newly created repository
        * Clicking this button will generate a new workspace with Gitpod's [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) where we can start working on our project
    2. Or we can use our GitHub repository's URL
        * Copy the repository URL from the browser
        * Enter gitpod.io/# in the browser and change the '#' symbol to our GitHub repository's URL

<br>

7. When the workspace is up and running we need to set up our Django environment first, to do that:
    1. Install Django by entering the following in the terminal: 
        ```
        pip3 install 'django<4'
        ```
    2. Install [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) PostgreSQL database adapter, by entering the following in the terminal: 
        ```
        pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
        ```
    3. We need to add every supporting dependency to a **'requirements.txt'** file by entering the following in the terminal after a dependency like **psycopg2** has been installed:
        ```
        pip3 freeze --local>requirements.txt
        ```
    4. Create our project by entering the following in the terminal:
        ```
        django-admin startproject 'PROJECT_NAME' .
        ```
        > replace **'PROJECT_NAME'** with our desired name for the project, also don't forget to add the '.' at the end of the command.
    5. Create a new App by entering the following in the terminal:
        ```
        python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME
        ```
        > replace the **'APP_NAME'** with the desired name for the app
    6. After the app has been created and shown up in our local directory, we need to add the app to the **INSTALLED_APPS** list in our **PROJECT_NAME** folder's **SETTINGS.py** file
    7. After our **APP_NAME** has been added to the **INSTALLED_APPS** enter the following in the terminal: 
        ```
        python3 manage.py makemigrations
        ```
        followed by
        ```
        python3 manage.py migrate
        ```
        > this will create our skeleton django project
    8. To see how our django skeleton project looks rendered in the browser, we need to add ```'localhost'``` to the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in our **PROJECT_NAME** folder's **SETTINGS.py** file
    9. Now we can run a local server with the following entered in the terminal:
        ```
        python3 manage.py runserver
        ```
    10. Click **Open Browser** to see the rendered application in the browser

<br>

8. For deploying the website we need to set up [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) cloud platform service
    1. Create a new account on Heroku and connect it with our GitHub account
    2. Sign in to our Heroku profile
    3. Click on **'New'** and select **'Create new app'**
    4. Name the app and choose the region(select Europe)
    5. Once the app is created, navigate to the **Settings** tab and add the following Buildpack:
        * **'heroku/python'**
    6. Then add the following Config Vars:
        * **PORT** : **8000**
        * **SECRET_KEY** : **YOUR_SECRET_KEY**
        * **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** : **1**
    7. Also, in **SETTINGS.py**, add ```'your-project-name-on-heroku.herokuapp.com'``` to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list, where ```localhost``` have been already added previously

<br>

9. Our Django database is only accessible within gitpod and is not suitable for production enviroment. The deployed project on a hosting service will not be able to access it, so we need to use [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) To use this service:
    1. Create an ElephantSQL account
    2. Click on **'+Create New Instance'**
    3. Set up plan
        * Name: **'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME'**
        * Plan: **'Tiny Turtle (free)'**
    4. Select region
        * Data center: **'EU West-1 (Ireland)'** 
    5. Click on **Review**
    6. Click on **Create Instance** 
    7. In the ElephantSQL dashboard, click on the newly added database
    8. Copy the URL with the button provided
    9. Add URL to the Heroku Config Vars
        ```
        DATABASE_URL: YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_ELEPHANT_SQL
        ```

<br>

10. To store our static files, we need to use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) cloud based service. To use this service:

<br>

11. Create a new file in our local directory and name it **env.py**
      1. Add **env.py** to the **.gitignore** file, to make sure it is not pushed to github as this file holds sensitive data
      2. at the top: 
          ```
          import os
          
          os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "YOUR_COPIED_CLOUDINARY_URL"
          os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_ELEPHANT_SQL"
          ```
      3. We need to make our Django project aware of our **env.py**, to do this, we need to add the following at the top of **SETTINGS.py**:
          ```
          import os

          import dj_database_url
          if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
          import env
          ```
      4. Now that this is done we can add our secret key to **env.py**
          ```
          os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
          ```
      5. Then in **SETTINGS.py** ,add:
          ```
          SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
          ```
      6. Find the **DATABASES** variable in **SETTINGS.py** and comment out the url above it and the **DATABASES'**  dictionary entirely
          > The reason for doing this is because the commented out code connects our Django application to the created db.sqlite3 database within our repository. However, as we know, that database is not suitable for production.
      7. To replace the commented out code, add the following:
          ```
          DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}
          ```
      8. Finally, it's now safe to save our changes, and push it to our repository in GitHub, to do this enter the following in the terminal:
            ```
            git add .

            git commit -m "Add your commit message here"

            git push
            ```

12. To push the changes to Heroku and make our initial deployment we need to create a file, called **Procfile** in our local directory, and add the following to it:
    ```
    web: gunicorn steezyspatula.wsgi
    ```
13. On Heroku, select our project and Navigate to the Deploy tab and select GitHub as the Deployment method
14. Click Connect to GitHub
15. With our GitHub profile selected, search for the correct GitHub repository and click "Connect"
16. Once the connection is done, select Enable Automatic Deploys (to make sure Heroku rebuilds the latest version after the final changes have been pushed to GitHub)
17. Finally select Deploy Branch in Manual deploy to make the initial deployment. (Automatic deploys work only after this step.)
18. Now that our Django environment is up and running, we can start working on our project by following Django's [MVT(Model View Template)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-project-mvt-structure/) structure
    > every time we want to create a view we need to do 3 things:
    1. Create the **view** in the **APP_NAME** directory's **views.py** file
    2. Create the **url path** for the **view** in the **APP_NAME** directory's **urls.py** file
    3. Create the **template** for the **view** to render in the specified **url path**, these are our custom html files added to our project's template folder in the root directory
19. We can now add models to our project within our **APP_NAME** folder's **models.py** file
    > every time we create, update or alter a model, or any field within our model we need to **save**, and type the following to the terminal:
    ```
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    > this will create a migration file with the applied changes to the database model
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ``` 
    > this will apply the changes to our database model

## Forking
